# Twitch Clip Batch Downloader  
![example-gif](https://github.com/amiechen/twitch-batch-loader/blob/master/example.gif)

### Pre-Install:

1) Get a twitch `Client ID` by registering a twitch app [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/dashboard/apps/create).
Once finished, copy the `Client ID`. You will need it to run the script.

2) Install python 3 on your machine if you haven't.

### Usage:

1) Install python packages
```
pip install requests
```

2) Delete the example clips in `clips.txt` and the ones your want. Put each URL on it's own line. No commas or anything like that.

3) Then run the batchloader script with your new Client Id using the provided clip list or create your list automatically with a provided broadcaster id, filtering by time is possible by provding two RFC3339 timestamps.
The resulting list is not complete though, maybe there is a cap after fetching approximately 1046 clips, the clips that are left out are neither the oldest nor the latest ones, really strange.
```
cd twitch-batch-loader
python batchloader.py <YOUR AWESOME CLIENT ID> [<THE AWESOME BROADCASTER ID> [<Start date of time frame> <End date of time frame>]]
```

Voil√†! once you see the finished message in your terminal, check the `downloads` folder in this repo and you should see the videos there.
